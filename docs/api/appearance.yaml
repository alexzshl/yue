    detail: |
      The dark mode of Windows 10 does not support Win32 apps officially and
      this API makes use of private APIs to force enabling dark mode for current
      app.

      Note that this API can only enable dark mode for window titlebars, all
      the views and colors are still using light color schemes. You should only
      use this API when developing custom-drawn apps.

  - signature: bool IsDarkScheme() const
    description: Return whether this app is using a dark color scheme.
    detail: |
      Note that on Windows the dark mode does not support Win32 apps, and this
      method will always return false unless dark mode is explicitly enabled
      with `<!name>SetDarkModeEnabled`.

events:
  - callback: void on_color_scheme_change()
